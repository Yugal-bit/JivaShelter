      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>Welcome to JivaShelter!</p>
      <p>We are students of Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology, and we have created this website for peoples to search and adopt a pet for themself.</p>
      <p>Animals in shelters often suffer from stress and loneliness due to overcrowding and lack of attention. By adopting, you give them a chance to experience love and happiness in a caring home.</p>
      <p>Our website connects you to various shelter homes and people in Pune with animals available for adoption. We provide you the connection to the audience if there is someone you need to be adopted.</p>
      <p>Thanks for visiting our website.</p>
